Welcome to the repository for **Space Traveller**, a 3D endless runner where the player pilots a futuristic spaceship through a treacherous, obstacle-filled cityscape. This project was a solo endeavor to build and refine the core mechanics of an infinite runner, focusing on responsive player controls and challenging level generation.

### ‚ú® Key Implemented Features

* **Responsive Spaceship Controls:** Direct control over the spaceship's movement to navigate tight spaces and avoid collisions.
* **Procedural Obstacle Spawning:** Obstacles are generated endlessly, ensuring every run is a unique challenge.
* **Collision System:** A robust collision detection system to handle interactions between the player's ship and the environment.
* **Sci-Fi Aesthetics:** A futuristic theme with cityscape models and a spaceship protagonist.

### Project Status

**This project is a functional prototype.** The core gameplay loop‚Äîcontrolling the ship and dodging endlessly spawning obstacles‚Äîis fully implemented and playable on `itch.io`. While additional features like a high-score system were planned, the primary goal of creating a stable and engaging endless runner mechanic was successfully achieved.

### üíª Technical Implementation

As the sole developer, I handled all programming and implementation in C#:

* **Player Controller:** Wrote the C# script that governs the spaceship's movement and responsiveness to player input.
* **Obstacle Spawner:** Created the system responsible for procedurally spawning and placing obstacles in the player's path.
* **Game Manager:** Set up the basic game state logic.
